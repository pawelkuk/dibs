# Master thesis

## TODO:

- [x] pgadmin init config
- [x] implement db per app
- [x] paying service
- [x] ticketing service
- [x] scripts for initial data
- [x] read model service
  - [x] update read service during saga
  - [x] push updates to FE
- [x] FE
  - [x] room component
  - [x] post request
  - [x] seat picker
  - [x] update room after read service update
  - [x] fix bug where too many sockets were being created
- [x] integration tests
  - [x] paying
  - [x] ticketing
- [x] orchestrating service/choreographing
  - [x] setup rabbitmq + celery
  - [x] setup auto-reload for celery
  - [x] write controller (saga workflow) as celery task/multiple tasks
- [x] experiment
  - [x] save time of reservation for further analysis
  - [x] save duration of the reservation for further analysis
  - [x] script which will reserve seats concurrently
  - [x] alternative - wait for response and only then send next request
  - [x] stats from experiments
    - [x] avg time to reserve seats
    - [x] number of requests which failed
    - [x] number of requests which succeeded
    - [x] time of experiment
  - [x] find out why inconsistent reservations appear
  - [x] check that payments and ticket renders are all correct
  - [x] check for correctness under heavy load
  - [x] write trigger/check for uniqueness of reserved seats
  - [x] different container for read and write path (CQRS) because due to writes reads become unresponsive due to queueing up requests on django
  - [x] read model service shows all screenings instead of just one with uuid given in url
  - [x] benchmark rewrite to CLI
  - [x] fix amount of queries generated by orm
- [x] distributed transactions approach
- [x] use uwsgi instead of django dev server
- [x] check periodically for updates in read model service
- [x] add spinner to FE
- [x] remove screening endpoint (mark as full)
- [x] update benchmarking script to creating/deleting screenings
- [x] gather data for thesis
- [x] visualize data
  - [x] high load
    - [x] time to reserve all seats (or almost all)
      - [x] avg
      - [x] std dev
      - [x] distribution
    - [x] time to complete a reservation
      - [x] avg
      - [x] std dev
      - [x] distribution
    - [x] success/failure rate (status code >= 400)
      - [x] avg
      - [x] std dev
      - [x] distribution
  - [x] small load
    - [x] time to reserve all seats (or almost all)
      - [x] avg
